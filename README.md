## What is this for? What is VSE?

VSE stands for **v**ibrational **S**tark **e**ffect, which can be understood as the response of molecular vibration upon electric field and such response can be quantitatively measured by the shift of vibrational frequencies for a bond stretching vibration (e.g. C=O stretching).
In this way, the strength of an electric field that the molecule ''feels'' can be determined with vibrational spectroscopy.

When applying VSE one normally assumes that the molecular vibration of the probe bond is completely localized, but this assumption might or might not hold for the molecule used as a vibrational Start effect **probe**.
Therefore, we need to determine to what extent the above assumption holds for one probe molecule. We solved this problem by utilizing a procedure which can decompose any molecular vibration (normal mode)
into the contributions of local vibrational modes (as part of the local vibrational mode theory). Higher contribution from the local probe bond stretching to the normal stretching mode means that we can use this probe molecule with higher confidence. 

In our recent work ([Sensors 2020, 20(8), 2358](https://doi.org/10.3390/s20082358)), we have evaluated more than 68 existing and potential vibrational Stark effect probes. 
However, one might propose a new vibrational probe which is not included in our work but it would be beneficial to test it before putting into use. 

Therefore, we set up this [server](https://vse-server.github.io/) to help. Once a submission is received, we will respond in less than 3 days and obtain the result in less than 7 days.
